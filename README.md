# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
## Brief Description of Project
* Around 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns were analyzed
* Campaigns were analyzed with the purpose of uncovering trends (e.g. Correlation between campaign success and month) to aid Louise in executing an optimal Kickstarter campaign for her play.
---
## Recommendations
* It was found that seasonality is significantly correlated to whether a Kickstarter campaign is successful or not. Specifically, the campaigns that launched in May/June experienced higher success rates than others. Therefore, it is recommended that Louise conduct her campaign in May/June.
* Additionally, the mean goal of successful theatre-play campaigns was found to be ~$5k. Therefore, it is suggested that Louise set her goal around there.
